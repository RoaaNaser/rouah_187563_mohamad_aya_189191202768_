                    <p class="card-text">The Messages of Sorrows is a miracle book in his statement of the philosophy of love and beauty, and it is a group of
                    messages that Al-Rafei used to provide bridges from Afanin and his grandfather to his beloved; to send them to his
                    friend Mahmoud Abi Rayya to share it with him and his grandfather, and Al-Rafei excelled in dividing the philosophy of
                    beauty; He divided beauty in his book into three sections: a beauty you feel, a beauty you love, a beauty you love, and
                    a beauty that is crazy with, and the division of thought: into a human, natural, and spiritual thought. The philosophy
                    of love and beauty at Al-Rafi'i carries with it a creativity in which he collects love in the gowns of literature, and
                    elevates it to the meadows of the soul.</p>
